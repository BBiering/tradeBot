### 1. Selection of stocks

We only select companies with market capitalization over $50 million, preferrably $200 million

Two factors are considered for selecting stocks to buy:

1. **Return on Capital** 

*EBIT / (Net Working Capital + Net Fixed Assets)*

2. **Earnings Yield**

*EBIT / (market value of equity + net interest-bearing debt)*
